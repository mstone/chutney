## Requirements

to test tor:

  * do some keygen
  * start tor instances
  * verify that they're running
  * connect to them as they're running


to start a tor instance:

  * give it a working dir
  * give it a config file
  * launch it


to launch it:

  * the config files must be computed


to see if a tor instance is running

  * either:
       * tail their logs
       * connect to them via their control port


current goal:

  * you start it up, then point a browser at it, then watch what happens


future goal:

  * multiple test plans/scenarios


misc goals:

  * you'd like to be able to parallelize across a cluster
  * it's batch-oriented
  * needs to log what it does
  * should be able to detect crashes
  * may have some machine-readable logging
  * easy to test multiple tor versions
  * needs to do interoperability tests
  * needs to run on win*, bsds, os x, linuxen
  * needs to enable coredumps
  * coredumps need to go separate
  * static linking


## Desired Tests

XFAIL "does it work with only one authority?"

TEST "does the network bootstrap?":

  * can I start the network,
  * do all of the Tors start
  * do all of the routers notice that they are routers
  * do the routers advertise themselves to the authorities
  * do the authorities arrive at a consensus
  * do the caches get the consensus
  * does the client get this information?
  * does the client build circuits

TEST "bootstrapping w/ 2 versions"

  * regular bootstrap procedure but start one tor process-group w/ a test version
